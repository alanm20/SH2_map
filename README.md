# SH2_map

Noesis plugin script for viewing Silent Hill 2 [PC] map files

Remember to have the area xx.map file in the same directory as the .map file. Plugin will look for common texutures in area map file.
Material texture blending does not quite work, remember to toggle Neosis's blending mode to make all meshes visible.

This is based on file format researchs from following repos:
